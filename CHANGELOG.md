## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Full-text search on both sites via Pagefind, indexed as a postbuild step
  and mounted lazily from the header's search trigger.
- GitHub Discussions-backed comments via giscus on blog posts and release
  pages, gated behind a real Discussion category ID per app.
- Cloudflare Web Analytics wiring in the shared Layout, enabled per app via
  a `PUBLIC_CF_BEACON_TOKEN` build-time env var.
- Release notes for mod repos, previously never synced since mods have no
  formal GitHub Releases - a repo's tags are now read directly when it has
  no Release objects at all.
- Real download links (with file size) on release pages with binary assets,
  and a per-product emoji seal on every release entry.

### Changed

- Release notes now come from that version's own section of `CHANGELOG.md`
  at its tag, not a GitHub Release's `body` - drops the download-instructions
  preamble and boilerplate footer that body carried, keeping only the actual
  changelog.
- A release page no longer repeats its title in the body, and its links are
  reordered: notes, downloads, a link to play the game, the release/tag link,
  the repo link, and (for a mod) a link to the main game repo.
- Only stable, non-prerelease versions are synced - excludes rolling "edge"
  builds and, since GitHub's own `prerelease` flag also marked every pre-1.0
  version that way, the pre-1.0 alpha history too.
- Release page URLs now keep a version's dots (`v1.3.0`, not `v130`) -
  the previous default id generation stripped them, which could collide
  across distinct versions.
